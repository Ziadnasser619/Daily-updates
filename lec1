# Lecture 1 Summary


### 1. **History of Vision Research**

* **Cambrian Explosion** -> rapid growth of species and visual systems \~540M years ago.
* **Camera Obscura** (16th–18th century) -> early optical devices.
* **Neuroscience** (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959):

  * Simple cells -> respond to oriented edges.
  * Complex cells -> detect movement and orientation.
  * Hypercomplex cells -> detect edges with endpoints.

### 2. **Milestones in Computer Vision**

* **1963 (Larry Roberts)** -> Block world (3D solids).
* **1970s (David Marr)** -> Visual representation pipeline:

  * Primal sketch -> 2.5D sketch -> 3D model.
* **1973–79** -> Pictorial structures & generalized cylinders.
* **1987 (David Lowe)** -> Early object recognition.
* **1997 (Shi & Malik)** -> Normalized cuts (segmentation).
* **2001 (Viola-Jones)** -> Real-time face detection.
* **1999 (SIFT, David Lowe)** -> Keypoint-based recognition.
* **2005 (HoG – Dalal & Triggs)** -> Human detection.
* **2006 (Spatial Pyramid Matching)** -> Scene classification.
* **2009 (DPM – Deformable Part Models)**.
* **2006–2012 (PASCAL VOC)** -> Standardized benchmarks.

### 3. **ImageNet**

* Introduced in **2009**.
* **14M images**, **22K categories**.
* Large-scale **ImageNet Classification Challenge (ILSVRC)**:

  * 1,000 classes, 1.4M images.
* Critical dataset for deep learning revolution.

### 4. **Deep Learning Revolution**

* **2012 (AlexNet – Krizhevsky, Sutskever, Hinton)** ->

  * CNN achieved breakthrough in ImageNet.
  * Used GPUs, deep architecture, ReLUs, dropout.
* Followed by:

  * **VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet** -> deeper, more efficient CNNs.

---



### 5. **CNN Basics**

* CNN = hierarchical feature learning:

  * Edges -> textures -> object parts -> full objects.
* Built from convolution, pooling, fully connected layers.
* Shift from hand-engineered features (SIFT, HoG) -> learned features via deep networks.

---

### 6. **Beyond Recognition**

* CNNs also apply to:

  * Segmentation.
  * Tracking.
  * 3D reconstruction.
  * Image captioning (CNN + RNN).
  * Visual reasoning and scene understanding.
